  It is a wonderful phone. The experience has been pretty much overwhelming and I'm really enjoying the handset.Pros:1. The screen is absolutely gorgeous to look at. I have seen other AMOLED panels from Xiaomi, Realme and even OnePlus but none match this one.2. The performance is pretty good. It feels snappy, no lag or crashes anywhere. Every app opens in a jiffy and there is no hang anywhere. I have also played Call of Duty and Asphalt quite heavily and they ran at the highest visual settings while maintaining very good fps.3. The camera is the best in class. Anyone eyeing at A71 would already be knowing that it has best camera in a phone below the 30k price. I am really surprised how well the cameras(both the front and back) work, even in low-light. With gcam mod installed, it performs extremely well. The photos are rich, detailed, sharp and contrasty. The portrait mode also works very nice. No issues whatsoever.4. Battery life is good. No issues there. Easily lasts me over a day with moderate gaming, heavy movie watching and using other apps. The fast charge is also quite handy and time saving.5. The overall build is very sturdy yet pretty slender and sleek. Even though the back is made of mostly plastic, you won't be able to tell. It looks gorgeous and the benefit of a glastic back is that it won't shatter if it falls.6. The audio through the audio jack is very very good. The included earphones are a bonus. I wasn't expecting them and to my surprise they sound very good, slightly better than the Realme bluetooth earphones. So, no complaints here.7. Having used stock android, zen ui, miui and colour os, I can firmly say that Samsung's One UI is better than all of them. Obviously it is not as fast as a stock android but the difference is so small I guess you wouldn't even be able to discern it. The OS is very intuitive, easy to use and has many useful features and functionalities which make it probably one of the best android implementation out there (if not the best).Cons:1. The on-screen fingerprint reader takes getting used to. It is not as fast as a non on-screen one and sometimes fails to recognise. Overall, it is good, just requires getting used to. However, it could be improved through software patch. Samsung, if you are reading this, kindly address it.2. The speaker on the phone is okay. For a 30k phone, the speakers are not justified.So overall it is a wonderful device and I would recommend that if your budget allows, it is definitely worth a try. Sure, there are better specd phones out there for the same or lower price but do they provide you the experience you get with Samsung? No, not even close. Also, inspite of the market rage, I am still not a fan of Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, etc. So it is also a factor which urged me over to Samsung.I hope you found my review useful.

  I do understand the inherent dichotomy in calling a phone as a premium VFM phone, but my analysis herein may be able to throw some light on it.This phone boasts of some superb features like SD 730 processors, perhaps one of the best mid-range processors, a 6.7-inch screen, premium plastic cover, but nevertheless its step-siblings of Chinese origin will cost at least 8K less, notwithstanding the same specifications. I got this phone for around Rs. 29,999/=, post cashback, deductions et al. Hence, it can truly be called a premium VFM phone. The question that would naturally arise as to why should you go for it then? or What could be the differentiating factor.First of all, this phone seems quite premium in hand, at least much better than its cheaper siblings. The range of customizations that this phone has right from battery optimization to display, are simply mind-boggling at this price point. You should not harbour a sky-high expectation though.Its display is crisp with just the right amount of shine and gloss, soothing to the eyes, yet quite snazzy.Camera and video pictures are vivid, crisp, just the type what an ordinary customer/user looks for.Holding in the hand does not give you any bulky feel, for though it has a large enough screen size, it is not that bulky in the pocket, though in tight jeans pants, it might not fit in into an ordinary built man/woman's pocket. Keep this in mind though.Battery life is decent, but with 4500 mAh battery, you must not expect two days of continuous usage. With two hours of talk time, some video meetings of around a little more than one hour, net surfing for around the same hour, watching video for around 2 hours will last you around 22 hours at a stretch, and this is available with 100 percent charge, to begin with. So you calculate accordingly, the battery energy of this phone.Its C-type charging cable's interface would mean, that such cable and the charger are not the ordinary type which you kept on using all these years. If you want a spare one, even though the cable is easily available, the charger adapter with its adequate fast charge characteristics are a little hard to come by and definitely is it costlier.Reception is good, but definitely not excellent. I am using the same with Airtel and Jio sim card and with Jio's good connectivity, I can only term it to be 'good' and definitely not 'excellent'.But for a user like me, for whom data security is definitely supreme, what keeps it different from the rest is the aspect of Samsung Knox, its security feature, which is quite a good one, and very reliable. Those conscious of data security, should go for this model perhaps only because of this.It has several innovative customisations, which are indeed very user friendly and convenient. Its side display mode is really very helpful and it also contributes to make it stand out from the rest of its cheaper siblings.All in all it is a premium VFM phone.

  I am writing after a month use. I bought first time Samsung phone and I am not gamer. I want good quality display and data security which serves this phone excellently. And camera samples I have added of day as well of night. In night it won't gives your very nice detailing but it gives natural color which enhances the image quality. Battery get charged fully in 1h-15min from 10% to 100% I have checked it multiple time, so it's time saving and it last more than day for me because I am a moderate user. Yes the cost of the phone is but high that is bad and fingerprint response is little slow but still I am happy with the phone because it gives flagship level feeling<U+0001F60A> because of it's design.

  It is a wonderful phone. The experience has been pretty much overwhelming and I'm really enjoying the handset.Pros:1. The screen is absolutely gorgeous to look at. I have seen other AMOLED panels from Xiaomi, Realme and even OnePlus but none match this one.2. The performance is pretty good. It feels snappy, no lag or crashes anywhere. Every app opens in a jiffy and there is no hang anywhere. I have also played Call of Duty and Asphalt quite heavily and they ran at the highest visual settings while maintaining very good fps.3.

  I am writing after a month use. I bought first time Samsung phone and I am not gamer. I want good quality display and data security which serves this phone excellently. And camera samples I have added of day as well of night. In night it won't gives your very nice detailing but it gives natural color which enhances the image quality. Battery get charged fully in 1h-15min from 10% to 100% I have checked it multiple time, so it's time saving and it last more than day for me because I am a moderate user. Yes the cost of the phone is but high that is bad and fingerprint response is little slow but still I am happy with the phone because it gives flagship level feeling<U+0001F60A> because of it's design.

  It is a wonderful phone. The experience has been pretty much overwhelming and I'm really enjoying the handset.Pros:1. The screen is absolutely gorgeous to look at. I have seen other AMOLED panels from Xiaomi, Realme and even OnePlus but none match this one.2. The performance is pretty good. It feels snappy, no lag or crashes anywhere. Every app opens in a jiffy and there is no hang anywhere. I have also played Call of Duty and Asphalt quite heavily and they ran at the highest visual settings while maintaining very good fps.3. The camera is the best in class. Anyone eyeing at A71 would already be knowing that it has best camera in a phone below the 30k price. I am really surprised how well the cameras(both the front and back) work, even in low-light. With gcam mod installed, it performs extremely well. The photos are rich, detailed, sharp and contrasty. The portrait mode also works very nice. No issues whatsoever.4. Battery life is good. No issues there. Easily lasts me over a day with moderate gaming, heavy movie watching and using other apps. The fast charge is also quite handy and time saving.5. The overall build is very sturdy yet pretty slender and sleek. Even though the back is made of mostly plastic, you won't be able to tell. It looks gorgeous and the benefit of a glastic back is that it won't shatter if it falls.6. The audio through the audio jack is very very good. The included earphones are a bonus. I wasn't expecting them and to my surprise they sound very good, slightly better than the Realme bluetooth earphones. So, no complaints here.7. Having used stock android, zen ui, miui and colour os, I can firmly say that Samsung's One UI is better than all of them. Obviously it is not as fast as a stock android but the difference is so small I guess you wouldn't even be able to discern it. The OS is very intuitive, easy to use and has many useful features and functionalities which make it probably one of the best android implementation out there (if not the best).Cons:1. The on-screen fingerprint reader takes getting used to. It is not as fast as a non on-screen one and sometimes fails to recognise. Overall, it is good, just requires getting used to. However, it could be improved through software patch. Samsung, if you are reading this, kindly address it.2. The speaker on the phone is okay. For a 30k phone, the speakers are not justified.So overall it is a wonderful device and I would recommend that if your budget allows, it is definitely worth a try. Sure, there are better specd phones out there for the same or lower price but do they provide you the experience you get with Samsung? No, not even close. Also, inspite of the market rage, I am still not a fan of Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, etc. So it is also a factor which urged me over to Samsung.I hope you found my review useful.

  I do understand the inherent dichotomy in calling a phone as a premium VFM phone, but my analysis herein may be able to throw some light on it.This phone boasts of some superb features like SD 730 processors, perhaps one of the best mid-range processors, a 6.7-inch screen, premium plastic cover, but nevertheless its step-siblings of Chinese origin will cost at least 8K less, notwithstanding the same specifications. I got this phone for around Rs. 29,999/=, post cashback, deductions et al. Hence, it can truly be called a premium VFM phone. The question that would naturally arise as to why should you go for it then? or What could be the differentiating factor.First of all, this phone seems quite premium in hand, at least much better than its cheaper siblings. The range of customizations that this phone has right from battery optimization to display, are simply mind-boggling at this price point. You should not harbour a sky-high expectation though.Its display is crisp with just the right amount of shine and gloss, soothing to the eyes, yet quite snazzy.Camera and video pictures are vivid, crisp, just the type what an ordinary customer/user looks for.Holding in the hand does not give you any bulky feel, for though it has a large enough screen size, it is not that bulky in the pocket, though in tight jeans pants, it might not fit in into an ordinary built man/woman's pocket. Keep this in mind though.Battery life is decent, but with 4500 mAh battery, you must not expect two days of continuous usage. With two hours of talk time, some video meetings of around a little more than one hour, net surfing for around the same hour, watching video for around 2 hours will last you around 22 hours at a stretch, and this is available with 100 percent charge, to begin with. So you calculate accordingly, the battery energy of this phone.Its C-type charging cable's interface would mean, that such cable and the charger are not the ordinary type which you kept on using all these years. If you want a spare one, even though the cable is easily available, the charger adapter with its adequate fast charge characteristics are a little hard to come by and definitely is it costlier.Reception is good, but definitely not excellent. I am using the same with Airtel and Jio sim card and with Jio's good connectivity, I can only term it to be 'good' and definitely not 'excellent'.But for a user like me, for whom data security is definitely supreme, what keeps it different from the rest is the aspect of Samsung Knox, its security feature, which is quite a good one, and very reliable. Those conscious of data security, should go for this model perhaps only because of this.It has several innovative customisations, which are indeed very user friendly and convenient. Its side display mode is really very helpful and it also contributes to make it stand out from the rest of its cheaper siblings.All in all it is a premium VFM phone.

I am really surprised how well the cameras(both the front and back) work, even in low-light. With gcam mod installed, it performs extremely well. The photos are rich, detailed, sharp and contrasty. The portrait mode also works very nice. No issues whatsoever.4. Battery life is good. No issues there. Easily lasts me over a day with moderate gaming, heavy movie watching and using other apps. The fast charge is also quite handy and time saving.5. The overall build is very sturdy yet pretty slender and sleek. Even though the back is made of mostly plastic, you won't be able to tell.

Obviously it is not as fast as a stock android but the difference is so small I guess you wouldn't even be able to discern it. The OS is very intuitive, easy to use and has many useful features and functionalities which make it probably one of the best android implementation out there (if not the best).Cons:1. The on-screen fingerprint reader takes getting used to. It is not as fast as a non on-screen one and sometimes fails to recognise. Overall, it is good, just requires getting used to. However, it could be improved through software patch. Samsung, if you are reading this, kindly address it.2. The speaker on the phone is okay. For a 30k phone, the speakers are not justified.So overall it is a wonderful device and I would recommend that if your budget allows, it is definitely worth a try.

  I do understand the inherent dichotomy in calling a phone as a premium VFM phone, but my analysis herein may be able to throw some light on it.This phone boasts of some superb features like SD 730 processors, perhaps one of the best mid-range processors, a 6.7-inch screen, premium plastic cover, but nevertheless its step-siblings of Chinese origin will cost at least 8K less, notwithstanding the same specifications. I got this phone for around Rs. 29,999/=, post cashback, deductions et al. Hence, it can truly be called a premium VFM phone. The question that would naturally arise as to why should you go for it then? or What could be the differentiating factor.First of all, this phone seems quite premium in hand, at least much better than its cheaper siblings. The range of customizations that this phone has right from battery optimization to display, are simply mind-boggling at this price point. You should not harbour a sky-high expectation though.Its display is crisp with just the right amount of shine and gloss, soothing to the eyes, yet quite snazzy.Camera and video pictures are vivid, crisp, just the type what an ordinary customer/user looks for.Holding in the hand does not give you any bulky feel, for though it has a large enough screen size, it is not that bulky in the pocket, though in tight jeans pants, it might not fit in into an ordinary built man/woman's pocket. Keep this in mind though.Battery life is decent, but with 4500 mAh battery, you must not expect two days of continuous usage. With two hours of talk time, some video meetings of around a little more than one hour, net surfing for around the same hour, watching video for around 2 hours will last you around 22 hours at a stretch, and this is available with 100 percent charge, to begin with. So you calculate accordingly, the battery energy of this phone.Its C-type charging cable's interface would mean, that such cable and the charger are not the ordinary type which you kept on using all these years. If you want a spare one, even though the cable is easily available, the charger adapter with its adequate fast charge characteristics are a little hard to come by and definitely is it costlier.Reception is good, but definitely not excellent. I am using the same with Airtel and Jio sim card and with Jio's good connectivity, I can only term it to be 'good' and definitely not 'excellent'.But for a user like me, for whom data security is definitely supreme, what keeps it different from the rest is the aspect of Samsung Knox, its security feature, which is quite a good one, and very reliable. Those conscious of data security, should go for this model perhaps only because of this.It has several innovative customisations, which are indeed very user friendly and convenient. Its side display mode is really very helpful and it also contributes to make it stand out from the rest of its cheaper siblings.All in all it is a premium VFM phone.

  I am writing after a month use. I bought first time Samsung phone and I am not gamer. I want good quality display and data security which serves this phone excellently. And camera samples I have added of day as well of night. In night it won't gives your very nice detailing but it gives natural color which enhances the image quality. Battery get charged fully in 1h-15min from 10% to 100% I have checked it multiple time, so it's time saving and it last more than day for me because I am a moderate user. Yes the cost of the phone is but high that is bad and fingerprint response is little slow but still I am happy with the phone because it gives flagship level feeling<U+0001F60A> because of it's design.

  It is a wonderful phone. The experience has been pretty much overwhelming and I'm really enjoying the handset.Pros:1. The screen is absolutely gorgeous to look at. I have seen other AMOLED panels from Xiaomi, Realme and even OnePlus but none match this one.2. The performance is pretty good. It feels snappy, no lag or crashes anywhere. Every app opens in a jiffy and there is no hang anywhere. I have also played Call of Duty and Asphalt quite heavily and they ran at the highest visual settings while maintaining very good fps.3. The camera is the best in class. Anyone eyeing at A71 would already be knowing that it has best camera in a phone below the 30k price. I am really surprised how well the cameras(both the front and back) work, even in low-light. With gcam mod installed, it performs extremely well. The photos are rich, detailed, sharp and contrasty. The portrait mode also works very nice. No issues whatsoever.4. Battery life is good. No issues there. Easily lasts me over a day with moderate gaming, heavy movie watching and using other apps. The fast charge is also quite handy and time saving.5. The overall build is very sturdy yet pretty slender and sleek. Even though the back is made of mostly plastic, you won't be able to tell. It looks gorgeous and the benefit of a glastic back is that it won't shatter if it falls.6. The audio through the audio jack is very very good. The included earphones are a bonus. I wasn't expecting them and to my surprise they sound very good, slightly better than the Realme bluetooth earphones. So, no complaints here.7. Having used stock android, zen ui, miui and colour os, I can firmly say that Samsung's One UI is better than all of them. Obviously it is not as fast as a stock android but the difference is so small I guess you wouldn't even be able to discern it. The OS is very intuitive, easy to use and has many useful features and functionalities which make it probably one of the best android implementation out there (if not the best).Cons:1. The on-screen fingerprint reader takes getting used to. It is not as fast as a non on-screen one and sometimes fails to recognise. Overall, it is good, just requires getting used to. However, it could be improved through software patch. Samsung, if you are reading this, kindly address it.2. The speaker on the phone is okay.

  I am writing after a month use. I bought first time Samsung phone and I am not gamer. I want good quality display and data security which serves this phone excellently. And camera samples I have added of day as well of night. In night it won't gives your very nice detailing but it gives natural color which enhances the image quality. Battery get charged fully in 1h-15min from 10% to 100% I have checked it multiple time, so it's time saving and it last more than day for me because I am a moderate user. Yes the cost of the phone is but high that is bad and fingerprint response is little slow but still I am happy with the phone because it gives flagship level feeling<U+0001F60A> because of it's design.

  It is a wonderful phone. The experience has been pretty much overwhelming and I'm really enjoying the handset.Pros:1. The screen is absolutely gorgeous to look at. I have seen other AMOLED panels from Xiaomi, Realme and even OnePlus but none match this one.2. The performance is pretty good. It feels snappy, no lag or crashes anywhere. Every app opens in a jiffy and there is no hang anywhere. I have also played Call of Duty and Asphalt quite heavily and they ran at the highest visual settings while maintaining very good fps.3. The camera is the best in class. Anyone eyeing at A71 would already be knowing that it has best camera in a phone below the 30k price. I am really surprised how well the cameras(both the front and back) work, even in low-light. With gcam mod installed, it performs extremely well. The photos are rich, detailed, sharp and contrasty. The portrait mode also works very nice. No issues whatsoever.4. Battery life is good. No issues there. Easily lasts me over a day with moderate gaming, heavy movie watching and using other apps. The fast charge is also quite handy and time saving.5. The overall build is very sturdy yet pretty slender and sleek. Even though the back is made of mostly plastic, you won't be able to tell. It looks gorgeous and the benefit of a glastic back is that it won't shatter if it falls.6. The audio through the audio jack is very very good. The included earphones are a bonus. I wasn't expecting them and to my surprise they sound very good, slightly better than the Realme bluetooth earphones. So, no complaints here.7. Having used stock android, zen ui, miui and colour os, I can firmly say that Samsung's One UI is better than all of them. Obviously it is not as fast as a stock android but the difference is so small I guess you wouldn't even be able to discern it. The OS is very intuitive, easy to use and has many useful features and functionalities which make it probably one of the best android implementation out there (if not the best).Cons:1. The on-screen fingerprint reader takes getting used to. It is not as fast as a non on-screen one and sometimes fails to recognise. Overall, it is good, just requires getting used to. However, it could be improved through software patch. Samsung, if you are reading this, kindly address it.2. The speaker on the phone is okay. For a 30k phone, the speakers are not justified.So overall it is a wonderful device and I would recommend that if your budget allows, it is definitely worth a try. Sure, there are better specd phones out there for the same or lower price but do they provide you the experience you get with Samsung? No, not even close. Also, inspite of the market rage, I am still not a fan of Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, etc. So it is also a factor which urged me over to Samsung.I hope you found my review useful.

  I do understand the inherent dichotomy in calling a phone as a premium VFM phone, but my analysis herein may be able to throw some light on it.This phone boasts of some superb features like SD 730 processors, perhaps one of the best mid-range processors, a 6.7-inch screen, premium plastic cover, but nevertheless its step-siblings of Chinese origin will cost at least 8K less, notwithstanding the same specifications. I got this phone for around Rs. 29,999/=, post cashback, deductions et al. Hence, it can truly be called a premium VFM phone. The question that would naturally arise as to why should you go for it then? or What could be the differentiating factor.First of all, this phone seems quite premium in hand, at least much better than its cheaper siblings. The range of customizations that this phone has right from battery optimization to display, are simply mind-boggling at this price point. You should not harbour a sky-high expectation though.Its display is crisp with just the right amount of shine and gloss, soothing to the eyes, yet quite snazzy.Camera and video pictures are vivid, crisp, just the type what an ordinary customer/user looks for.Holding in the hand does not give you any bulky feel, for though it has a large enough screen size, it is not that bulky in the pocket, though in tight jeans pants, it might not fit in into an ordinary built man/woman's pocket. Keep this in mind though.Battery life is decent, but with 4500 mAh battery, you must not expect two days of continuous usage. With two hours of talk time, some video meetings of around a little more than one hour, net surfing for around the same hour, watching video for around 2 hours will last you around 22 hours at a stretch, and this is available with 100 percent charge, to begin with. So you calculate accordingly, the battery energy of this phone.Its C-type charging cable's interface would mean, that such cable and the charger are not the ordinary type which you kept on using all these years. If you want a spare one, even though the cable is easily available, the charger adapter with its adequate fast charge characteristics are a little hard to come by and definitely is it costlier.Reception is good, but definitely not excellent. I am using the same with Airtel and Jio sim card and with Jio's good connectivity, I can only term it to be 'good' and definitely not 'excellent'.But for a user like me, for whom data security is definitely supreme, what keeps it different from the rest is the aspect of Samsung Knox, its security feature, which is quite a good one, and very reliable. Those conscious of data security, should go for this model perhaps only because of this.It has several innovative customisations, which are indeed very user friendly and convenient. Its side display mode is really very helpful and it also contributes to make it stand out from the rest of its cheaper siblings.All in all it is a premium VFM phone.

The portrait mode also works very nice. No issues whatsoever.4. Battery life is good. No issues there. Easily lasts me over a day with moderate gaming, heavy movie watching and using other apps. The fast charge is also quite handy and time saving.5. The overall build is very sturdy yet pretty slender and sleek. Even though the back is made of mostly plastic, you won't be able to tell. It looks gorgeous and the benefit of a glastic back is that it won't shatter if it falls.6. The audio through the audio jack is very very good. The included earphones are a bonus. I wasn't expecting them and to my surprise they sound very good, slightly better than the Realme bluetooth earphones. So, no complaints here.7. Having used stock android, zen ui, miui and colour os, I can firmly say that Samsung's One UI is better than all of them. Obviously it is not as fast as a stock android but the difference is so small I guess you wouldn't even be able to discern it. The OS is very intuitive, easy to use and has many useful features and functionalities which make it probably one of the best android implementation out there (if not the best).Cons:1. The on-screen fingerprint reader takes getting used to. It is not as fast as a non on-screen one and sometimes fails to recognise. Overall, it is good, just requires getting used to. However, it could be improved through software patch. Samsung, if you are reading this, kindly address it.2. The speaker on the phone is okay. For a 30k phone, the speakers are not justified.So overall it is a wonderful device and I would recommend that if your budget allows, it is definitely worth a try. Sure, there are better specd phones out there for the same or lower price but do they provide you the experience you get with Samsung? No, not even close. Also, inspite of the market rage, I am still not a fan of Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, etc. So it is also a factor which urged me over to Samsung.I hope you found my review useful.

  I do understand the inherent dichotomy in calling a phone as a premium VFM phone, but my analysis herein may be able to throw some light on it.This phone boasts of some superb features like SD 730 processors, perhaps one of the best mid-range processors, a 6.7-inch screen, premium plastic cover, but nevertheless its step-siblings of Chinese origin will cost at least 8K less, notwithstanding the same specifications. I got this phone for around Rs. 29,999/=, post cashback, deductions et al. Hence, it can truly be called a premium VFM phone. The question that would naturally arise as to why should you go for it then? or What could be the differentiating factor.First of all, this phone seems quite premium in hand, at least much better than its cheaper siblings. The range of customizations that this phone has right from battery optimization to display, are simply mind-boggling at this price point. You should not harbour a sky-high expectation though.Its display is crisp with just the right amount of shine and gloss, soothing to the eyes, yet quite snazzy.Camera and video pictures are vivid, crisp, just the type what an ordinary customer/user looks for.Holding in the hand does not give you any bulky feel, for though it has a large enough screen size, it is not that bulky in the pocket, though in tight jeans pants, it might not fit in into an ordinary built man/woman's pocket. Keep this in mind though.Battery life is decent, but with 4500 mAh battery, you must not expect two days of continuous usage. With two hours of talk time, some video meetings of around a little more than one hour, net surfing for around the same hour, watching video for around 2 hours will last you around 22 hours at a stretch, and this is available with 100 percent charge, to begin with. So you calculate accordingly, the battery energy of this phone.Its C-type charging cable's interface would mean, that such cable and the charger are not the ordinary type which you kept on using all these years. If you want a spare one, even though the cable is easily available, the charger adapter with its adequate fast charge characteristics are a little hard to come by and definitely is it costlier.Reception is good, but definitely not excellent. I am using the same with Airtel and Jio sim card and with Jio's good connectivity, I can only term it to be 'good' and definitely not 'excellent'.But for a user like me, for whom data security is definitely supreme, what keeps it different from the rest is the aspect of Samsung Knox, its security feature, which is quite a good one, and very reliable. Those conscious of data security, should go for this model perhaps only because of this.It has several innovative customisations, which are indeed very user friendly and convenient. Its side display mode is really very helpful and it also contributes to make it stand out from the rest of its cheaper siblings.All in all it is a premium VFM phone.

  I am writing after a month use. I bought first time Samsung phone and I am not gamer. I want good quality display and data security which serves this phone excellently. And camera samples I have added of day as well of night. In night it won't gives your very nice detailing but it gives natural color which enhances the image quality. Battery get charged fully in 1h-15min from 10% to 100% I have checked it multiple time, so it's time saving and it last more than day for me because I am a moderate user. Yes the cost of the phone is but high that is bad and fingerprint response is little slow but still I am happy with the phone because it gives flagship level feeling<U+0001F60A> because of it's design.

  It is a wonderful phone. The experience has been pretty much overwhelming and I'm really enjoying the handset.Pros:1. The screen is absolutely gorgeous to look at. I have seen other AMOLED panels from Xiaomi, Realme and even OnePlus but none match this one.2. The performance is pretty good. It feels snappy, no lag or crashes anywhere. Every app opens in a jiffy and there is no hang anywhere. I have also played Call of Duty and Asphalt quite heavily and they ran at the highest visual settings while maintaining very good fps.3. The camera is the best in class. Anyone eyeing at A71 would already be knowing that it has best camera in a phone below the 30k price. I am really surprised how well the cameras(both the front and back) work, even in low-light. With gcam mod installed, it performs extremely well. The photos are rich, detailed, sharp and contrasty. The portrait mode also works very nice. No issues whatsoever.4. Battery life is good. No issues there. Easily lasts me over a day with moderate gaming, heavy movie watching and using other apps. The fast charge is also quite handy and time saving.5. The overall build is very sturdy yet pretty slender and sleek. Even though the back is made of mostly plastic, you won't be able to tell. It looks gorgeous and the benefit of a glastic back is that it won't shatter if it falls.6. The audio through the audio jack is very very good. The included earphones are a bonus. I wasn't expecting them and to my surprise they sound very good, slightly better than the Realme bluetooth earphones. So, no complaints here.7. Having used stock android, zen ui, miui and colour os, I can firmly say that Samsung's One UI is better than all of them. Obviously it is not as fast as a stock android but the difference is so small I guess you wouldn't even be able to discern it.

  I am writing after a month use. I bought first time Samsung phone and I am not gamer. I want good quality display and data security which serves this phone excellently. And camera samples I have added of day as well of night. In night it won't gives your very nice detailing but it gives natural color which enhances the image quality. Battery get charged fully in 1h-15min from 10% to 100% I have checked it multiple time, so it's time saving and it last more than day for me because I am a moderate user. Yes the cost of the phone is but high that is bad and fingerprint response is little slow but still I am happy with the phone because it gives flagship level feeling<U+0001F60A> because of it's design.

  It is a wonderful phone. The experience has been pretty much overwhelming and I'm really enjoying the handset.Pros:1. The screen is absolutely gorgeous to look at. I have seen other AMOLED panels from Xiaomi, Realme and even OnePlus but none match this one.2. The performance is pretty good. It feels snappy, no lag or crashes anywhere. Every app opens in a jiffy and there is no hang anywhere. I have also played Call of Duty and Asphalt quite heavily and they ran at the highest visual settings while maintaining very good fps.3. The camera is the best in class. Anyone eyeing at A71 would already be knowing that it has best camera in a phone below the 30k price. I am really surprised how well the cameras(both the front and back) work, even in low-light. With gcam mod installed, it performs extremely well. The photos are rich, detailed, sharp and contrasty. The portrait mode also works very nice. No issues whatsoever.4. Battery life is good. No issues there. Easily lasts me over a day with moderate gaming, heavy movie watching and using other apps. The fast charge is also quite handy and time saving.5. The overall build is very sturdy yet pretty slender and sleek. Even though the back is made of mostly plastic, you won't be able to tell. It looks gorgeous and the benefit of a glastic back is that it won't shatter if it falls.6. The audio through the audio jack is very very good. The included earphones are a bonus. I wasn't expecting them and to my surprise they sound very good, slightly better than the Realme bluetooth earphones. So, no complaints here.7. Having used stock android, zen ui, miui and colour os, I can firmly say that Samsung's One UI is better than all of them. Obviously it is not as fast as a stock android but the difference is so small I guess you wouldn't even be able to discern it. The OS is very intuitive, easy to use and has many useful features and functionalities which make it probably one of the best android implementation out there (if not the best).Cons:1. The on-screen fingerprint reader takes getting used to. It is not as fast as a non on-screen one and sometimes fails to recognise. Overall, it is good, just requires getting used to. However, it could be improved through software patch. Samsung, if you are reading this, kindly address it.2. The speaker on the phone is okay. For a 30k phone, the speakers are not justified.So overall it is a wonderful device and I would recommend that if your budget allows, it is definitely worth a try. Sure, there are better specd phones out there for the same or lower price but do they provide you the experience you get with Samsung? No, not even close. Also, inspite of the market rage, I am still not a fan of Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, etc. So it is also a factor which urged me over to Samsung.I hope you found my review useful.

  I do understand the inherent dichotomy in calling a phone as a premium VFM phone, but my analysis herein may be able to throw some light on it.This phone boasts of some superb features like SD 730 processors, perhaps one of the best mid-range processors, a 6.7-inch screen, premium plastic cover, but nevertheless its step-siblings of Chinese origin will cost at least 8K less, notwithstanding the same specifications. I got this phone for around Rs. 29,999/=, post cashback, deductions et al. Hence, it can truly be called a premium VFM phone. The question that would naturally arise as to why should you go for it then? or What could be the differentiating factor.First of all, this phone seems quite premium in hand, at least much better than its cheaper siblings. The range of customizations that this phone has right from battery optimization to display, are simply mind-boggling at this price point. You should not harbour a sky-high expectation though.Its display is crisp with just the right amount of shine and gloss, soothing to the eyes, yet quite snazzy.Camera and video pictures are vivid, crisp, just the type what an ordinary customer/user looks for.Holding in the hand does not give you any bulky feel, for though it has a large enough screen size, it is not that bulky in the pocket, though in tight jeans pants, it might not fit in into an ordinary built man/woman's pocket. Keep this in mind though.Battery life is decent, but with 4500 mAh battery, you must not expect two days of continuous usage. With two hours of talk time, some video meetings of around a little more than one hour, net surfing for around the same hour, watching video for around 2 hours will last you around 22 hours at a stretch, and this is available with 100 percent charge, to begin with. So you calculate accordingly, the battery energy of this phone.Its C-type charging cable's interface would mean, that such cable and the charger are not the ordinary type which you kept on using all these years. If you want a spare one, even though the cable is easily available, the charger adapter with its adequate fast charge characteristics are a little hard to come by and definitely is it costlier.Reception is good, but definitely not excellent. I am using the same with Airtel and Jio sim card and with Jio's good connectivity, I can only term it to be 'good' and definitely not 'excellent'.But for a user like me, for whom data security is definitely supreme, what keeps it different from the rest is the aspect of Samsung Knox, its security feature, which is quite a good one, and very reliable. Those conscious of data security, should go for this model perhaps only because of this.It has several innovative customisations, which are indeed very user friendly and convenient. Its side display mode is really very helpful and it also contributes to make it stand out from the rest of its cheaper siblings.All in all it is a premium VFM phone.
